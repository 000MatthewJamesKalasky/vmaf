Included are
- iCID_Metric:
	A MATLAB implementation of the improved color-image-difference (iCID) metric which predicts the perceived difference of two images.
- Optimizing_Gamut_Mapping:
	A MATLAB implementation of the gamut-mapping optimization which optimizes a gamut-mapped image by minimizing the iCID metric of the original image and the gamut-mapped image.
